Question......

A company pays its employees as managers (who receive a fixed monthly salary), hourly workers (who receive a fixed hourly wage for up to the first 40 hours they work and “time-and-a-half,” i.e., 1.5 times their hourly wage, for overtime hours worked), commission workers (who receive 750 plus 5.7% of their gross weekly sales), or pieceworkers (who receive a fixed amount of money per item for each of the items they produce—each pieceworker in this company works on only one type of item). Write a program to compute the weekly pay for each employee. You do not know the number of employees in advance. Each type of employee has its own pay code: Managers have paycode 1, hourly workers have code 2, commission workers have code 3 and piece workers have code 4.
